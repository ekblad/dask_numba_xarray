    "# Numba\n",
    "Numba is good for interfacing your user-defined Python functions into very fast machine code (for any machine!). Numba's speed is in repeated applications of the same functions, as it compiles the function into machine code in the first pass and is very fast when calling it afterward. This applies to functions that do mostly scalar and vector operations and do not rely on specialized Python libraries and objects. If Numba can recognize the types/shapes of the inputs and the mapping to outputs, it could be made much faster. "
